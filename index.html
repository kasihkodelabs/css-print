          <h1>The Importance of Writing Well & How to Grow as a Writer</h1>
          <p>UPDATED May 26, 2021</p>

          <p>
            Writing is an essential part of college, but it’s also essential for
            most professions, your personal life, and your community
            participation. You may not realize just how much writing you do—an
            email to your boss or employees, a note to your child’s teacher,
            your resume and cover letter, a survey about improvements to your
            city or neighborhood, or a text asking your partner to do something
            for you. We are all writers and communicators!
          </p>

          <h2>Reasons to Improve Your Writing</h2>
          <h3>1. Writing has become the #1 way we communicate with others.</h3>
          <p>
            We do more writing as a society than ever before. It has now become
            the primary way we gather information and interact and connect with
            others. Improving your written communications allows you to
            confidently communicate with everyone. Writing is often the first
            impression that others have of us.
          </p>
          <p>Writing is often the first impression that others have of us.</p>

          <h3>2. People judge you based on your writing.</h3>
          <p>
            Our writing is often the first impression that others have of us.
            People often read our writing before ever meeting us face to face.
            Errors or disorganized or incomplete thoughts in our writing lead
            others to make assumptions about our intelligence and our character.
          </p>

          <h3>
            3. You’re more likely to get what you want with clear and direct
            writing.
          </h3>
          <p>
            Writing is a form of communication. We often communicate in order to
            request something of someone. If the one reading your request cannot
            fully understand or locate what you need from them, you are not
            likely to get your request fulfilled.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Writing is an essential job skill.</h3>
          <p>
            Even if you don’t do a lot of writing on the job (which is rare),
            you still communicate in other ways. Improving your writing helps
            you to become a better communicator overall and it also improves
            your reading, which is another essential job skill. And your ability
            to write a well-crafted application, resume, and cover letter is the
            first step to getting a job.
          </p>

          <h3>5. Writing expresses your thinking skills.</h3>
          <p>
            Disorganized writing could indicate that your thinking is
            disorganized. If your writing is not fully developed, it could
            indicate that you have not fully developed your thoughts. Improving
            your writing skills will improve the way you think about your topic
            and help you explain or discuss it with others.
          </p>

          <h2>How to Get Writing Support to Help you Improve</h2>
          <h3>1. Look at writing samples and writing guides.</h3>
          <p>
            Did you know there are different writing expectations depending on
            the type of writing you are doing, the audience, and the purpose?
            Use the UAGC Writing Center’s Types of Writing guide to see samples
            and understand the expectations of different types of writing you
            may need to do. Some examples of different types of writing include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Academic Writing</li>
            <li>Business or Professional Writing</li>
            <li>Graduate-Level Academic Writing</li>
            <li>Writing as an Educator</li>
            <li>Writing for the Web</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>2. Use a proofreading tool.</h3>
          <p>
            Errors can creep into the writing of even the most experienced
            writers. And as we mentioned before, these errors can get in the way
            of what you are trying to communicate and could cause your reader to
            make some undesirable assumptions about you. Use Grammarly to help
            you catch any minor grammatical, punctuation, and style errors you
            might have missed.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a UAGC student, you have access to a free premium Grammarly
            account. And access to this account will continue even after you’ve
            graduated!
          </p>

            areas of your life—academic, professional, civic, and personal. So

            great communicator!
